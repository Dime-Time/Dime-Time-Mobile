## Slide 2: The Problem
### Americans Are Drowning in Debt

- **$1.1 Trillion** in credit card debt nationwide
- Average household carries **$6,194** in credit card debt
- **Only 32%** of Americans pay off their credit cards monthly
- Traditional debt payoff feels overwhelming and slow
- Most people struggle to find "extra" money for debt payments

**The Question:** *What if we could automate debt payoff using money you don't even notice?*

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
### Dime Time: Micro-Payments, Macro Results

**Core Concept:** Round up every purchase to the nearest dollar and use spare change for debt payments and wealth building.

**Example:**
- Coffee: $4.67 → Rounds to $5.00 → $0.33 goes to debt
- Gas: $37.42 → Rounds to $38.00 → $0.58 goes to debt
- Groceries: $67.31 → Rounds to $68.00 → $0.69 goes to debt

**Result:** Painless debt reduction that happens automatically with every purchase.

# TALKING POINTS REFERENCE

## Opening Hook (2 minutes)
"Raise your hand if you've ever bought coffee and paid with a card. Now raise your hand if you carry any credit card debt. What if I told you that same coffee purchase could automatically help pay off that debt? That's exactly what Dime Time does - it turns every purchase into progress toward financial freedom."

## Problem Statement (3 minutes)
"The average American household carries over $6,000 in credit card debt. The minimum payment trap keeps people paying for decades. Traditional advice says 'just pay more,' but where's that extra money supposed to come from? We found it hiding in plain sight - in the spare change from every purchase you already make."

## Solution Demo (10 minutes)
**[Show live app throughout]**
"Let me show you Sarah's actual account. She's a typical user with three debts totaling almost $24,000. Look at her recent transactions - coffee, gas, groceries. See these round-up amounts? They're automatically calculated and applied to her highest-interest debt. In just this month, she's generated $1.61 in extra payments without changing her spending habits at all."

## Technology Credibility (2 minutes)
"This isn't some startup experiment. We use Plaid for bank connections - the same technology that powers Venmo and Robinhood. Coinbase handles our cryptocurrency transactions. Bank-level security protects every user. This is enterprise-grade financial infrastructure made simple."

## Market Opportunity (2 minutes)
"70% of Americans carry credit card debt. That's 175 million potential users. Even capturing 1% of this market represents 1.75 million users paying $10/month. That's a $210 million annual revenue opportunity from a single feature that most people would gladly pay for."

## Closing Impact (1 minute)
"Sarah will be debt-free 4 years earlier using Dime Time. That's $12,400 in interest she'll never pay. Multiply that by millions of users, and we're talking about eliminating billions in consumer debt while building wealth. This isn't just an app - it's a financial movement."

## Q&A Preparation
**Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
A: "Subscription model at $9.99/month for premium features, plus small transaction fees from crypto purchases and potential interchange revenue from partner banks."

**Q: "What about security?"**
A: "We never store banking credentials. Plaid handles all bank connections with read-only access. We use the same security standards as major financial institutions."

**Q: "Why not just save the round-ups?"**
A: "Debt typically carries 18-25% interest rates. By paying debt first, users get a guaranteed 18-25% return, which beats most investment options. Plus, becoming debt-free enables more aggressive wealth building later."

**Q: "What if users don't make enough transactions?"**
A: "Average person makes 15-20 card transactions per week. Even small round-ups add up - our users average $47.50 monthly in extra payments, which can save thousands in interest."
