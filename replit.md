# Dime Time - Fintech Debt Reduction App

## Project Overview
Dime Time is an innovative fintech application that transforms debt reduction into an engaging, user-friendly experience, now featuring advanced sweep account integration with JP Morgan Chase and **full Replit-based user authentication**.

The application leverages automated financial tracking, micro-investment strategies, and round-up collection mechanisms to help users systematically reduce debt through small, consistent actions and intelligent fund management.

## Recent Changes (December 2024)

### Authentication Removal âœ“
- **Removed All Authentication**: Per user request, completely removed login/logout system
- **Reverted Database Schema**: Back to original username/password structure
- **Unprotected All API Routes**: All endpoints now use demo user ("demo-user-1") for development
- **Removed Landing Page**: App now directly shows dashboard without authentication flow
- **Navigation Cleanup**: Removed logout buttons and authentication states

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, wouter routing
- **Backend**: Node.js Express with PostgreSQL database
- **Authentication**: None - uses hardcoded demo users for development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM using in-memory storage
- **API Security**: No authentication required, demo user data for development

## User Preferences
- Clean, modern UI with focus on user experience
- Secure authentication flow without disrupting existing data
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Mobile-responsive design with intuitive navigation
